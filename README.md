# EatTheBlocks-Critter-Developer-NFT-Challenge

In the same vein as CryptoKitties and Axie Infinity, the EatTheBlocks NFT challenge involves creating "breedable" developers - by "fusing" two developers to create a super full-stack developer with a mixture of frontend and backend traits from his constituent halves

So, this was supposed to be like Pokemon or Axie Infitnity breeding .... but for blockchain developers. "Breeding" strayed too far into uncomfortable/weird territory for
me, so I decided to make my frontend and backend developers Super Saiyan fuse (a la DBZ) into a super full-stack developer. The overwhelming majority of blockchain developers
are male anyway, and I've tried to accurately reflect this gender distribution in my game
